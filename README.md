# Multi-language-Text-To-Speech
<br>
This project is a Flask-based web application that converts text into speech in multiple languages.
The application uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to generate speech audio files from the input text, supporting languages like English and Hindi.
Users can input text, select the desired language, and receive an audio playback of the converted speech directly on the webpage.
